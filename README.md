# FormVault – Admin Request Tracker

FormVault is a full-stack internal tool for submitting and managing employee requests such as leave, travel reimbursements, or work-from-home approvals. It is built using Python Flask, HTML, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and SQLite. This project simulates real-world internal tools used in organizations to streamline operations.

## Features

- Internal request form with structured fields
- Frontend validation using JavaScript
- Data persistence using SQLite (no external DB required)
- Admin dashboard with responsive Bootstrap table view
- Organized code structure using Flask’s standard conventions

## Technologies Used

| Layer     | Tech Stack                         |
|-----------|-------------------------------------|
| Frontend  | HTML5, Bootstrap 5, JavaScript      |
| Backend   | Python 3.11, Flask                  |
| Database  | SQLite3 (lightweight embedded DB)   |
| Tools     | Git, GitHub                         |


## How It Works

- User visits `/` to access the internal request form.
- JavaScript checks that all fields are filled properly.
- On submission, Flask captures the data and stores it in a SQLite database.
- The user is redirected to `/dashboard`, where all past submissions are listed in a styled table.
